ScribeUI
=========

ScribeUI is an application to create mapfiles with many scale levels.

To get the latest **release**, clone this repo and then checkout the latest tag. ``` git describe --abbrev=0 ``` to view the latest tag.

Migrating from ScribeUI v0.5 to v1.0 is explained at the end of this file.

The following instruction installations were tested on ubuntu precise.


**Requirements**

* Mapserver 6.4.1
* Apache 2.2
* Make

Production installation
------------

You need to install apache2 with mod_wsgi:

    sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi

**Note** mod_wsgi 3.4 or more is recommended. [How to compile mod_wsgi 3.4 on ubuntu precise](http://scribeui.org/faq.html#wsgi-how)


Configuration
-------------

First, clone the repository in a folder www-data will be able to access. In this configuration example, the scribeui folder will be located at ```/opt/scribeui```

Then, copy the default production settings:

    cp production.ini local.ini

Make sure the mapserver url in local.ini points to your mapserver path:
	- line 35: mapserver.url

Edit the proxy.cgi file and add your server host to the list of allowed hosts if different from localhost (localhost is already included.)

Create a file 'pyramid.wsgi' with the following content, editing the path to your scribeui installation:

	from pyramid.paster import get_app, setup_logging
	ini_path = '/opt/scribeui/local.ini'
	setup_logging(ini_path)
	application = get_app(ini_path, 'main')


You can use the Makefile to automatically setup ScribeUI for you, simply run:

       sudo make
       export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
       export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
       sudo chown -R youruser .
       make install
       sudo make perms


Next step is adding the app to apache, here is an example configuration for Apache 2.2:

    WSGIDaemonProcess scribeui user=www-data group=www-data threads=10 \
	        python-path=/opt/scribeui/lib/python2.7/site-packages
	WSGIScriptAlias /scribeui /opt/scribeui/pyramid.wsgi

	<Directory /opt/scribeui>
	        WSGIApplicationGroup %{ENV:APPLICATION_GROUP}
	        WSGIPassAuthorization On
	        WSGIProcessGroup scribeui
	        Order deny,allow
	        Allow from all
	</Directory>

If you use Apache 2.4, the configuration is slightly different:

    WSGIDaemonProcess scribeui user=www-data group=www-data threads=10 \
	        python-path=/opt/scribeui/lib/python2.7/site-packages
	WSGIScriptAlias /scribeui /opt/scribeui/pyramid.wsgi

	<Directory /opt/scribeui>
	        WSGIApplicationGroup %{ENV:APPLICATION_GROUP}
	        WSGIPassAuthorization On
	        WSGIProcessGroup scribeui
	        Require all granted
	</Directory>

Once apache is restarted, ScribeUI should be available!

    sudo service apache2 restart

Downloading template data is optional, but recommended for a better
experience:

        sudo make load-demo-data

If you omit this step, the maps you create from default templates will display pink tiles.


Development installation
------------

These instructions are for running a development version of ScribeUI. It is pretty good for a local version of the application. Production installation instructions are available below.

    cp development.ini local.ini

Review the following parameters in local.ini, and edit them if needed:

	- sqlalchemy.url
	- workspaces.directory
	- scribe.python
	- cgi.directory
	- mapserver.url

Edit the proxy.cgi file and add your server host to the list of allowed hosts if different from localhost (localhost is already included.)

You can use the Makefile to automatically setup ScribeUI for you, simply run:

        export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
        export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
        sudo make
        make install

This will download and install the required dependencies, setup the differents
configurations files and install them in the proper directories.

To launch the server at http://localhost:6543/:

        make start

Downloading template data is optional, but recommended for a better
experience.

        sudo make load-demo-data


This will download some natural earth data and will help you get started with
ScribeUI by making templates readily working so you don't start with an empty
mapfile. (The template code is still available if you don't download the data,
but the result will be pink tiles).

Migrating from v0.5 to v1.0
-----------------------------

Before pulling and installing ScribeUI v1.0, first change all file's permission back to your own user:

    sudo chown -R user application/

You may now follow the production installation instructions and install ScribeUI v1.0

Once the installation is finished and  ScribeUI up, you may import your old workspaces changing the workspace folder and the database to your user:

    sudo chown -R user scribeui.sqlite workspaces/

Then executre the update script:

    python update.py

Then change the database and workspace folders back to www-data:

    sudo chown -R www-data scribeui.sqlite workspaces/

Your workspaces and maps will then be imported, although passwordless.

Each map will have to be edited to delete or comment the following line in the map editor:

    CONFIG "MS_ERRORFILE" "../debugFile.log"
